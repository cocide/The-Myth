The Myth
========

PHP interface for movie browsing based upon a standardized naming convention.
This page was designed to utilize a particular naming sequence, it will probably not be useful to anyone but Cocide, RKuykendall, and GonMD.
Anyone may use this under the GPLv3 license.



Things that Need to Eventually Happen
=====================================
Add searching.
  things like genre, rating, actor, studio, producer, runtime, budget, box, resolution, year, rating
Fix the CSS to make it not wrap the text
Fix the layout of the names
Add MPAA icons instead of txt
Put an icon for the highest rez next to the title
Make a cron based update script to update the ratings weekly
  Maybe also background the first pull of data rather than have the page just sit 'loading'
Improve security
Fix general layout inconsistencies on the data
Handle year 0000 and rating -1 better
Add a graphical edit for each movie (to spot-fix bugs)
Update the 3+ year old JS
Clean URLs
